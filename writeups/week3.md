### Profeball shell printed

### Progress made on electronics mountings (cad drawings, dxf files showing plans).
I dimensioned the holes and outermost plates for either side of the Profeball. Because of that, it's now very easy to make adjustments to where we want those electronics placed if we want to move them/how big the plates are/make new plates. 

I made room for the RC522 wiring to go to the bottom half of the shell. Plus room for the clip of the Pokeball on both plates. The top plate is actually a bit smaller (120mm) than the bottom plate (134mm) because it sits a little inside the top of the shell to avoid colliding with the ST7735. There's a hole in it because the joystick also collides with the plate a little.

The bottom plate has room for the screen and joystick to be attached. I'm not sure yet if the joystick will be mounted from the top or bottom side, I need to see what thickness of arylic we have. If it is too thick, it will collide with the pins.

I tested the dimensions by printing on a 1:1 scale on paper and cutting it out. For the laser cut version, I will have to sand down the outside edges so they're curved if the material is thick. You can see the size difference I mentioned earlier here.

I'm thinking of wanting to frost or paint the arylic so you can't see the electronics inside, but I need to lasercut some non-paper prototypes first.
